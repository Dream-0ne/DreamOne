## Contributing
When working on stories this is the format that will be followed to contribute to the repo
 1. Make sure you are on the master branch (git checkout master)
 2. Make sure the master branch is updated (git pull) 
 3. Create a branch for the specific story that you are working on (git checkout -b nameofbranchhere) 
 4. Make sure naming convention for branch is similar to story
 5. Once you have implemented the feature push the code to the branch
   - git add .
   - git commit -m "your commit message here"
   - git push
 6. Once you have pushed go to branch on github and create pull request and add information into pull request
 7. Pull request information Template:
   - Story Link: <add story link here>
   - Story Name: <story name>
   - Description: This feature does x and y and z with a and b and c 
   - Sanity Check: Go to page /filename and do x and y and z and what should be appearing is a and b and c
 8. Address any feedback from the reviewer
 9. Once the reviewer approves it merge the code to the master branch
